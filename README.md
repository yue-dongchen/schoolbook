# Schoolbook
*Work- and notebook for content relating to my HSC school subjects*

**Principles:**
* **Separate *exercises* from *notes***: The first group chiefly focusses on aiding thinking *hier und jetzt*. We record things on some external medium during the process of thinking to overcome limitations of our brains - to think, practise and reinforce; and sometimes for communication/presentation to others. We are not concerned with, nor can we be certain about, whether they will be suitable as review notes. They are ephemeral writings that are mostly irrelevant for later review, at least in their originally produced form.\
The second group are review notes. They should not be mixed in the same file as one of *exercise*/*ephemeral* writings.\
\
Therefore, two directories in this fashion.
* **The structure should be modular/atomic**, allowing for quick editing and flexible presentation. It is not uncommon for us to quickly switch between subjects e.g. as new thoughts emerge, and to switch between the workbook and notebook. And review is not necessarily highly segmented by subject either. For this:
    * Name the files by date. One day per file.
    * Within each file, subjects can be delineated by Typst functions. (This enables modularity.)
    * Thus the workbook and notebook are in this one repo.
